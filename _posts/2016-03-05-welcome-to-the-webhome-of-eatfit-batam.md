**If We Are What We Eat, Then Eat Fit And Be Fit**

Proper nutrition can be very challenging for many people, especially with all the choices we have in a country as rich in culinary diversity as Indonesia. But making healthy food choices shouldn't have to be a daily puzzle.
EatFit was founded with the mission of helping people achieve their healthy weight through catering plans based on the world-renowned Mayo Clinic Diet, adapted to locally-available ingredients and culinary styles in Indonesia. But we don't just stop at providing catering solutions; we also want to help you learn as much as you can about the why's, how's and how-to's of finding out what your healthy weight should be, and how a balanced diet and some physical activity can help get you to your target weight as soon -- and as safely -- as possible.
But let us be clear: We're not doctors or dieticians or fitness specialists (we do however have access to nutritionists who help us with the meal planning). We are people who have had the same struggle with weight and food choices as many others. And along the way, after the usual experiments with the fad diet of the moment and gaining back whatever was lost -- if any weight was lost -- once we couldn't stand it any longer, we decided to educate ourselves with scientifically sound healthy eating and weight management information so we could safely and sustainably see results.
And you know what? Most of that information and knowledge is already out there and publicly available. You might have to buy a book or two but a diligent search online can yield many of the most important points to take to heart. One of the key learnings for us is that the only thing a diet should restrict -- or control, which sounds less oppressive -- is the number of calories consumed each day. Not a food group, like carbs or fats or proteins, or specific foods, like meat or eggs or ice cream. 
Paracelsus once declared: "All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison." This is no clearer than in food -- the amount makes a food 'bad' for you; eaten in moderation and within your 'calorie budget,' no food should be off the table.
So besides our core business activity that is the catering service, we're also here to share with you the knowledge and other resources we've come across in our nutrition journey so far. If you have something to share back (e.g. tips, recipes, achievements), we'd be happy to review it and share it accordingly with the community we're building here.
We look forward to welcoming you as a customer!
